abstract: This paper moves towards causally estimating the role that stereotyping and systemic mis-prediction plays in perpetuating the health entrepeneur gender gap. First, I document a persistent gender disparity in US-based, funded, health founders and investing general partners between 2005 and 2024. I find women make up only 12.2% of all funded health founders and 18% of investing GPs on average. I, then, investigate the phenomena of gender homophily, where investors disspraportionately invest in founders that share their gender identity. Applying a disparities based, differences-in-differences framework I find that a change in the city gender composition of GPs from all men to all women predicts a doubling in the share of funded health founders who are women in first round investments. Further, using an adapted outcomes test I find that men were 50% more likely to IPO when investing in women than when investing in men. These results together are consistent with VCs relying on gender steretypes to inform investing deecisions under high informational asymmetries.
