      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I research the economic incentives that determine the direction of medical innovation. Who and what do we innovate for? 
        
        My current research uses quantitiative methods to investigate the role that demographic distributions play in who benefits and who pays for medical innovation. In particular, I am focused on how individual identities of founder and investor impact innovation outcomes in early-stage private capital markets. 
        
        My other interest for future research examines the role of the political economy on priority setting for medical innovation. I am interested both in the private market (foundations, patient advocacy, etc) and policy (lobbying, FDA revolving door, etc) mechanisms.
